\begin{article}[Ideal Fluid]
    Air is described as an incompressible and inviscid fluid, or \emph{idea fluid}. By means of incompressibility, air shall have a constant density $\rho$, which is independent of all spatial and temporal changes. This hypothesis is counterintuitive at first, and we shall discuss its applicability now.

    By means of inviscid we mean a fluid where no friction exists anywhere and any moment inside fluid. It demands the fluid to be
